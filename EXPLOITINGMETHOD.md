## Buffer Overflow Common Terms
Heap:                       Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
Stack:                      A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
Registers:                  Storage elements as close as possible to the central processing unit (CPU)
Instruction Pointer (IP):   a.k.a Program Counter (PC), contains the address of next instruction to be executed
Stack Pointer (SP):         Contains the address of the next available space on the stack
Base Pointer (BP):          The base of the stack
Function:                   Code that is separate from the main program that is often used to replace code the repeats in order to make the program smaller and more efficient
Shellcode:                  The code that is executed once an exploit successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability

## Buffer Overflow Defenses
    Non executable (NX) stack
    Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
    Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
    Stack Canaries
    Position Independent Executable (PIE)

## Technical Help
### Utilizing tools such as:
    IDA, GHIDRA
    GDB, MONA, IMMUNITY
    BASH, PYTHON

# GDB Uses
## Installation of Peda Plugin
git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit

## Common Commands
disass <FUNCTION>         #   Disassemble portion of the program
info <...>                #   Supply info for specific stack areas
x/256c $<REGISTER>        #   Read characters from specific register
break <address>           #   Establish a break point
